          The goal of the Computer Science Club is to create a space where like-minded individuals can grow in their careers and prepare for real-world programming. We want to help you build skills that extend beyond the classroom while also connecting you with peers of all experience levels. This club is meant to be a safe and welcoming environment where you can practice, write, and learn code together. It's also a place to explore your creativity through projects that interest you and inspire collaboration.
