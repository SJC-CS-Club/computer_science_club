          <strong>
            Thank you to everyone who joined us for our first official meeting
            of the semester!
          </strong>{" "}
          It was amazing to see both familiar and new faces coming together to
          kick off the Computer Science Club.
          <br />
          <br />
          For those who couldn't make it, here's a quick recap:
          <br />
          <br />
          The goal of the Computer Science Club is to create a space where
          like-minded individuals can grow in their careers and prepare for
          real-world programming. We want to help you build skills that extend
          beyond the classroom while also connecting you with peers of all
          experience levels. This club is meant to be a safe and welcoming
          environment where you can practice, write, and learn code together.
          It's also a place to explore your creativity through projects that
          interest you and inspire collaboration.
          <br />

          Thank you so much to everyone who came out to today's Computer Science
          Club meeting! It was great seeing such an engaged group of students
          ready to learn and grow together.
          <br />
          <br />
          üìö Today, we focused on Git and GitHub, two essential tools for
          version control and collaboration that every software engineer uses in
          the real world. Whether you're working on solo projects or
          contributing to a team, these tools will help you manage code, track
          changes, and work more efficiently.
          <br />
          <br />
          To help you keep learning, I've included resources below:

          üßë‚Äçüíª We also announced officer positions for anyone interested in taking
          on a leadership role in the club. If this interests you, simply reply
          to this email with your name and the position you'd like to be
          considered for. We'll be announcing officer selections during next
          week's meeting on <strong>Wednesday, October 8th (10/8/25)</strong>.
          <br />
          <br />
          ‚ö°Next week, we'll be taking the next big step, starting work on a
          real-world coding project together! This will be a hands-on
          opportunity to build something meaningful, strengthen your technical
          skills, and collaborate with other members.
          <br />
          <br />
          We're excited to see what we can create as a team and to keep pushing
          our programming skills to the next level.
          <br />
          <br />
          Have a great week, and keep coding! üíª‚ú®
